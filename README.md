Stereo Frequency Visualizer

- [ ] Get L and R signals with ~~NAudio~~[^1] CSCore
- [ ] Apply FFT or DFT to get frequencies
- [ ] Draw frequencies in a form
- [ ] Make the form transparent
- [ ] Make the form always on top
- [ ] Improve configurability
- [ ] Set up for system tray

[^1]: Ran into latency issues with the NAudio buffer, basically un-usable for games because I need real-time. CSCore claims to be built for real-time processing.
